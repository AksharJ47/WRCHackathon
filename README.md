#### Project description

Twitter scrap for information on leakages which account for 37% South Africa's water being lost without reaching end-users.
The project aims to establish the most common cause of water wastage and if possible give a measure of the most critical parts
 of the South African system and provide service providers with quick up-to-date information to act on.
